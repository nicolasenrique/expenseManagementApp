Thanks for visiting my app.


- In order to start this app please enter the following command from your terminal:"npm run dev". Don't forget to run "npm-install" before.
- This app currently allows to add and erase personal incomes and expenses. From the app's back-end it's possible to edit registries via Postman but this still hasn't been added to the front-end.

Cheers,

Nicolás
